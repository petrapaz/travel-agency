    excerpt: 'Discover the vibrant tastes and smells of Split, from fresh seafood at the fish market to traditional peka.',
    fullContent: `The heart of Split beats within the ancient walls of Diocletian's Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site that's more of a living city than a museum. As you wander its cobblestone streets, the scent of grilled fish and fresh pastries fills the air. The city's main market, 'Pazar', and the fish market, 'Peškarija', are bustling hubs of local life.\n\nDon't miss trying 'peka', a traditional Dalmatian dish where meat or seafood is slow-cooked under embers in a bell-shaped lid. Pair it with a glass of local Pošip wine for an authentic taste of Split. It’s a culinary experience that perfectly captures the soul of this vibrant Mediterranean city.`,

    excerpt: 'Listen to the unique sound of Zadar\'s sea organ, an architectural object and an experimental musical instrument.',
    fullContent: `On the western end of Zadar's Riva, you'll find a truly unique art installation. The Sea Organ (Morske orgulje), designed by architect Nikola Bašić, is a series of underwater pipes that play music powered by the rhythm of the waves. As the sea pushes air through the pipes, it creates a hauntingly beautiful and constantly changing melody.\n\nRight next to it is another installation, the Greeting to the Sun, which collects solar energy during the day and puts on a spectacular light show after sunset, perfectly synchronized with the music of the Sea Organ. It's a magical fusion of human ingenuity and natural forces, creating an unforgettable experience.`,
